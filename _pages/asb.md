I credit the Alternative Spring Break (ASB) Programs with setting the path for my UW experience. The ASB programs are a part of <a href = "https://expd.uw.edu/riverways/rural-tribal/">Riverways Education Partnerships </a> (formerly known as The Pipeline Project) and serve rural and tribal schools across Washington State. 

<h1>The Beginning</h1>

I first participated in the Environmental Spring Break Program (EASB) in 2013 during my freshman year. My team worked with elementary and middle school students at the Quileute Tribal School in La Push, Washington. As an international student, I was motivated to participate in the program to learn more about Washington and its communities. 

EASB was a pivot point in my undergraduate trajectory. Educating students about the environment instilled in me a deep appreciation for it. Therefore, I decided to switch my major from molecular biology to electrical engineering with the hopes of studying sustainable energy. It was also my first experience as an educator. EASB was the first inkling that creating impact and connecting with a diverse community were core to my sense of purpose.


<h1>Giving Back</h1>

The switch to engineering was not easy. I suffered from imposter syndrome and lost sight of what motivated the switch. Instead of pursuing sustainability, I chose the path everyone around me was following and focused on embedded computing systems, an area I was not excited by, but had the best job prospects. I graduated with a good grade, but lost a sense of purpose. In 2016, I started my Masters program in ECE and was looking for opportunities where I could have direct impact on a community. 

I approached The Pipeline Project with the idea to have an engineering focused ASB. They already had a new STEM ASB program, but it lacked an engineering focus. Consequently, we engaged with a new school (Granger High School) in Yakima Valley and brought to the students an engineering design focused curriculum. I was involved with the program until 2020. 

The ASB programs prompted me to discover my values, realize my identity as an educator and be a confident engineer who could drive impact while connecting with communities in need. It highlighted the importance of empathy, culturally-responsive and community-oriented education, which inform the tenets of my teaching philosophy.
