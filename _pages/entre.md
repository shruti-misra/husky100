  <figcaption>I developed a <a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1880021630/the-wired-outlet-energy-control-through-the-cloud?ref=discovery&term=Dimos%20Katsis">smart power outlet </a> for Athena Energy Corp</figcaption>

In 2015, I interned at a startup called Athena Energy Corp. Although the startup failed, it was an incredible experience in developing a product from scratch and learning about how a startup worked. It got me curious about what drove successful technological innovation. <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/husky100/engine/">ENGINE </a> fueled this curiosity because by supporting participating companies in product development, I was participating in the innovation process. These experiences motivated my decision to pursue a PhD in innovation studies.

Meanwhile, after a summer internship at a big organization (Microsoft), I reflected on my experience at Athena and realized that at a smaller venture, I had greater ownership of the product and more opportunity for direct impact. So, I combined my research with entrepreneurial interests in order to "learn by doing" and enrolled in the <a href = "https://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/entrepreneurship-certificate/">Foster School of Business's Tech Entrepreneurship Certificate (TEC)</a>. 

Through TEC, I have the opportunity to participate in an accelerator <a href = "https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">(Creative Destruction Labs)</a>, which helps digital health startups bring product to market. I am also participating in the <a href = "https://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/entrepreneurship-competitions/uw-health-innovation-challenge/">Holloman Health Innovation Challenge</a> in a team, to explore bringing a new type of vaginal dilator to market, targeted towards a diverse population (women, transgender and intersex) who need vaginal dilation therapy.

These experiences taught me how entrepreneurship and technological innovation can drive social impact and enrich my scholarship on it through first-hand experience.
