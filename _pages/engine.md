<h1>The Beginning</h1>

In 2015, I participated in the electrical and computer engineering department's pilot for a capstone course, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. My team worked with Booz Allen Hamilton and I designed a system to track an underwater remotely operated vehicle. The project was technically challenging and being the only woman on the team was unnerving. However, completing the project and having a supportive team truly helped me build confidence in my abilities and find community.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

After an impactful capstone experience, I volunteered to mentor the team continuing my project next year. At this point, ENGINE was growing and had room for improvement. Therefore, I was delighted when I was made a lead teaching assistant (TA) for it in 2018. I could now substantially impact student experience by connecting with students as they solved complex problems and help them see challenges as opportunities for growth. However, empathy was not sufficient to drive change, I needed evidence to support any intervention I was proposing. Therefore, I decided to study ENGINE as part of my dissertation. 

Broadly, my research involves studying the innovation process. However, my original direction of modeling innovation mathematically felt dissatisfying as it was removed from concrete application. Meanwhile, I saw ENGINE as a platform for innovation and the students and industry mentors as agents driving the process. By studying ENGINE for my dissertation, I can directly apply research insights to course improvement, while studying it as an example of innovative activity.

ENGINE has harmonized all aspects of my identity. It helped me become a confident engineer, an innovative educator and a hands-on scholar.
