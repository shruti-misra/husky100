The Alternative Spring Break (ASB) Programs have catalyzed my unique UW experience. The programs are a part of <a href = "https://expd.uw.edu/riverways/rural-tribal/">Riverways Education Partnerships </a> (formerly known as The Pipeline Project) that serve rural and tribal schools across Washington State. 

<h1>The Beginning</h1>

I first participated in the Environmental ASB in 2013 during my freshman year. My team worked with elementary and middle school students at the Quileute Tribal School in La Push, Washington. As an international student, I was motivated to participate in the program to learn more about Washington and its communities. 

EASB was a critical juncture in my undergraduate trajectory. Educating students about the environment instilled in me a deep appreciation for it. Therefore, I decided to switch my major from molecular biology to electrical engineering, wanting to study sustainable energy. It was also my first experience as an educator. 


<h1>Giving Back</h1>

TThe switch to engineering was challenging. I suffered from imposter syndrome and lost sight of why I changed majors. Instead of pursuing sustainability, I focused on embedded computing, an area I was not excited by, but I pursued it because everyone around me was doing it as it led to better job prospects. I graduated with a good grade, but lost a sense of purpose. So, when I started my Masters program in electrical engineering, I was looking for opportunities to use my skills to help communities in need.   

I approached The Pipeline Project with an idea to have an engineering ASB. Consequently, we worked with a new school (Granger High School) in Yakima Valley and brought to its students an engineering focused curriculum. I was involved with the program until 2020. 
 
ASB prompted me to discover my values, realize my identity as an educator and be an engineer with a purpose, who could create impact while connecting with diverse communities. It highlighted the importance of empathy and community-oriented education, facets of my teaching philosophy, which I use today as a teaching assistant.
