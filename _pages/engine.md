<h1>The Beginning</h1>

In 2015, I participated in the electrical and computer engineering department's pilot for a capstone course, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. My team worked with Booz Allen Hamilton and I designed a system to track an underwater remotely operated vehicle. The project was technically challenging and being the only woman on the team was unnerving. However, completing the project and having a supportive team truly helped me build confidence in my abilities and find community.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

After an impactful capstone experience, I volunteered to mentor the team continuing my project next year. At this point, the program was growing and had room for improvement. Therefore, I was delighted when I was made a lead teaching assistant (TA) for it in 2018. I could now substantially impact student experience by connecting with students as they solved complex problems and help them see challenges as opportunities for growth.

In addition to providing a significant undergraduate engineering experience, ENGINE also inspired a shift in my PhD. My research initially focused on developing mathematical models for the innovation process. This direction felt too theoretical and removed from concrete application. Meanwhile, I saw the capstone as a platform for innovation and the students and industry mentors as agents driving the process. Therefore, I decided to study the capstone as part of my dissertation. The insights generated from my research inform evidence-based curricular interventions for the course. 

Through ENGINE I have 

* grown as an educator
* gained confidence and breadth of knowledge as an engineer
* discovered my interest in innovation and entrepreneurship.
