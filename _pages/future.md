  caption: My visual art contribution to UW Bricolage's 34th Issue
excerpt: |
  "*Always go a little further into the water than you feel you're capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. 
  And when you feel that your feet aren't quite touching the bottom, you're just about in the right place to do something exciting*"
  
  **-David Bowie**

My Husky experience has been about asking "what more can I be and how else can I contribute?" In answering those questions through my UW journey, I have learned resilience and unabashed authenticity. I'm unafraid of being lost, because it usually leads to a new discovery about myself, the world or a way to impact society.

I'm still contemplating which path to take after I graduate. However, regardless of the path, I believe that my Husky experience has endowed me with the education, relationships, self-awareness and grit required to lead impact wherever I go.
