<h1>Starting with Gratitude</h1>

My journey at the UW began in 2012, when I arrived in Seattle from Dubai to study Molecular Biology. I was 17, in a different country, nervous yet excited. Almost a decade later, I am an engineer, still abuzz with excitement. However, my nervousness has been replaced by a solid sense of identity and values, which have been cultivated through a vibrant mosaic of UW experiences.  <br>

<br>

The Husky experience has given me countless opportunities to learn, fail, grow and reflect on who I am and what is meaningful to me. Upon graduation, I will not only possess invaluable professional skills, but will have a wealth of incredible relationships for the rest of my life. The UW has shaped me into who I am now and I am grateful to be a part of its community and have the opportunities it has to offer.

<ul>
<li><b>Engineer</b></li>
</ul>

My education has made me a confident engineer who is comfortable navigating a highly technical field and addressing challenges pertinent to the world. <br>

<li><b>Educator</b></li>
</ul>

Through my experiences as an educator at the UW, I have recognized that <em>empathy, evidence and community</em> drive my teaching philosophy. <br>

<li><b>Experiential Scholar/Entrepreneur</b></li>
</ul>

UW's innovative ecosystem has encouraged my interests in innovation and entrepreneurship, which inspire my graduate research and future goals.  <br>

<h1>Values</h1>

All elements of my identity are driven by three core values that I discovered during my UW journey.
