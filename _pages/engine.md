<h1>The Beginning</h1>

In 2015, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering piloted a capstone course, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. My team was in the first cohort and worked on a project with Booz Allen Hamilton. I designed a system to track an underwater remotely operated vehicle, as GPS does not work underwater. Despite being challenging, the project made me feel like I was working on something significant and enhanced my confidence in my skills.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

This capstone involves uncertainty inherent in any design process, making it challenging for students who don't have experience with defining a feasible project. Therefore, I was delighted to be given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant (TA) for the capstone, as the program was growing and had room for impact on student experience.

I have been the lead TA for the capstone since 2018. With support from the instructor, I have introduced curricular interventions based on information I collect from students. As a TA, I like to connect with students as they navigate the complex problem-solving experience and help them see challenges as opportunities for growth. 

The capstone not only provided an impactful engineering experience as an undergraduate, it also inspired a shift in my PhD. My initial research focused on developing mathematical models for the innovation process. This direction felt too theoretical and removed from realistic application. Meanwhile, I saw the capstone as a platform for innovation and the students and industry mentors as agents driving the process. Therefore, I decided to study the capstone experience as part of my dissertation. The insights generated from my research inform evidence-based curricular interventions for the course.
