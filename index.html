  "*Always go a little further into the water than you feel you're capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. 
  And when you feel that your feet aren't quite touching the bottom, you're just about in the right place to do something exciting*"
  
  **-David Bowie**

<h1>Starting with Gratitude</h1>

My journey at the University of Washington began in 2012, when I arrived in Seattle from Dubai to study Cell and Molecular Biology. I was seventeen years old, in a different country and masked nervousness with excitement and a sense of adventure. Almost a decade later, I am an engineer and still abuzz with excitement and a sense of adventure. However, my nervousness has been replaced by an innate confidence and trust in my abilities that has been cultivated through a vibrant mosaic of a Husky experience. <br>

<br>

My time at the UW has solidified <b>my values and the foundations of my identities</b>. It has provided me with countless opportunities to learn, fail, grow and reflect on how can I contribute to my communities and the world. At the end of my UW experience, I will not only possess an invaluable set of professional skills, but more importantly, will have a trove of incredible relationships for the rest of my life. The University of Washington has shaped me into the person I am now and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be here and partake in all that it has to offer.
