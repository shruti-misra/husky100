My first entrepreneurial experience was a summer internship for small startup called Athena Energy Corp in 2015. I developed a smart power outlet for them among other projects. While the startup was unsuccessful, it was an incredible experience in developing a product from start to finish and learning how a business works. 

The ENGINE capstone has complemented my entrepreneurial interests, as it supports participating companies in rapid product development and allows me to see the needs that drive their business. Through the capstone, I have seen a variety of new technologies driven by diverse business needs.

After my summer internship at Microsoft (a big company) in 2019, I realized that what I most value about entrepreneurship is that in a small venture, I had greater ownership of the product and more opportunity for direct impact. 

These experiences have influenced me to conduct academic research and participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. I have enrolled in the Foster School of Business's Tech Entrepreneurship Certificate (TEC), through which I have the opportunity to participate in the Creative Destruction Labs Accelerator and help digital health startups achieve their business goals. 

I am also participating in the Holloman Health Innovation Challenge
