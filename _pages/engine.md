<h1>The Beginning</h1>

In 2015, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering piloted a capstone course, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. My team was in the first cohort and worked on a project with Booz Allen Hamilton. I designed a system to track an underwater remotely operated vehicle, as GPS does not work underwater. Despite being challenging, the project was my first real-world engineering experience and bolstered confidence in my skills.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

The capstone involves uncertainty inherent in any design process, making it challenging for students who don't have experience defining a feasible project. Therefore, I was delighted to be given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant (TA) for the program, as it was growing and had room for impact on student experience. I have been the lead TA for the capstone since 2018. With support from the instructor, I have introduced curricular interventions based on data I collect from students. My favorite part about being a TA is connecting with students as they navigate the complex problem-solving experience and help them see challenges as opportunities for growth. 

The capstone not only provided an impactful engineering experience as an undergraduate, it also inspired a shift in my PhD. My research initially focused on developing mathematical models for the innovation process. This direction felt too theoretical and removed from realistic application. Meanwhile, I saw the capstone as a platform for innovation and the students and industry mentors as agents driving the process. Therefore, I decided to study the capstone as part of my dissertation. The insights generated from my research inform evidence-based curricular interventions for the course.
