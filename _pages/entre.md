  <figcaption>Smart power outlet for Athena Energy Corp</figcaption>

In 2015, I was a summer intern at a startup called Athena Energy Corp. I developed a <a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1880021630/the-wired-outlet-energy-control-through-the-cloud?ref=discovery&term=Dimos%20Katsis">smart power outlet </a>for them among other projects. Although the startup failed, it was an incredible experience in developing a product from start to finish and learning how a business worked. I started becoming curious about what leads to innovation. The ENGINE capstone fueled the curiosity, because it  supported participating companies in rapid product development, allowing me to experience innovation in action. Therefore, I decided to pursue a PhD to study technological innovation as a scholar. 

Meanwhile, after a summer internship at a big organization (Microsoft), I reflected back to my experience at Athena and realized that at a smaller venture, I had greater ownership of the product and more opportunity for direct impact. I combined my research with entrepreneurial aspirations and decided to "learn by doing" by enrolling in the Foster School of Business's Tech Entrepreneurship Certificate (TEC).

Through TEC, I am participating in the Creative Destruction Labs (CDL) Accelerator and helping digital health startups bring product to market. Additionally, my friend and I are participating in the Holloman Health Innovation Challenge to develop our idea of a new vaginal dilator that can enable less painful vaginal dilation therapy for those in need.
