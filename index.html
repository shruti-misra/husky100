<h1>Starting with Gratitude</h1>

My UW journey began in 2012, when I arrived in Seattle from Dubai to study Molecular Biology. I was 17, in a different country,  diffident yet excited. Almost a decade later, I am an engineer and still excited. However, my diffidence has given way to a strong set of values and identity, which have been established through a vibrant mosaic of UW experiences. <br>

<br>

The Husky experience has given me countless opportunities to learn, fail, grow and reflect on who I am and what is meaningful to me. Upon graduation, I will not only possess invaluable professional skills, but will have a wealth of incredible relationships for the rest of my life. The UW has shaped me into who I am now and I am grateful to be a part of its community and have the opportunities it has to offer.

<h1>Identities</h1>

In addition to identifying as a heterosexual woman of color, my Husky experiences have revealed the following facets of my identity:
