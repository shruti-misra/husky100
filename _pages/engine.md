<h1>The Beginning</h1>

In 2016, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering piloted a new capstone course, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. My team was in the first cohort and worked on a project with Booz Allen Hamilton. I designed a system to track an underwater remotely operated vehicle, as GPS does not work underwater. Despite being challenging, the project made me feel like I was working on something impactful, which enhanced my confidence in my engineering skills.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

The capstone is a unique experience as involves a level of uncertainty inherent in any design process and makes it challenging for students who do not have experience with scoping and executing on a project. Therefore, I was delighted to be given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant (TA) for it, as the program was growing and had room for impact on curriculum design and student experience.

I have been the lead TA for the capstone since 2018, constantly working to improve it. With support from the instructor, I am able to introduce many curricular intervention based on information I collect from students. My goal is to connect with students as they navigate the complex problem-solving experience and help them see challenges as opportunities for growth. 


Being a student in the capstone enhanced my confidence as an engineer and being a TA for it inspired a shift in my PhD. My initial research focused on developing mathematical models for the innovation process. This direction was dissatisfying as it lacked direct engagement with people and real-world data. I saw the capstone as a platform for innovation and the students and industry mentors as agents driving the process. Therefore, I decided to study the capstone design experience as part of my dissertation and use it to collect evidence to inform my teaching.
