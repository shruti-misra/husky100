  "*Always go a little further into the water than you feel you're capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. 
  And when you feel that your feet aren't quite touching the bottom, you're just about in the right place to do something exciting*"

<h1>Starting with Gratitude</h1>

My journey at the University of Washington began in 2012, when I arrived in Seattle from Dubai to study Molecular Biology. I was 17 years old, in a different country and masked nervousness with excitement and a sense of adventure. Almost a decade later, I am an engineer and still abuzz with excitement and a sense of adventure. However, my nervousness has been replaced by an innate confidence and trust in my abilities that has been cultivated through a vibrant mosaic of my UW experience. <br>

<br>

My time at the UW has solidified <b>foundations of my identity and my values</b>. It has provided me with countless opportunities to learn, fail, grow and reflect on how can I contribute to my communities and the world. Upon graduation from UW, I will not only possess an invaluable set of professional skills, but more importantly, I will have a trove of incredible relationships for the rest of my life. The University of Washington has shaped me into the person I am today and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be part of the UW community and partake in all that it has to offer.

<h2>Engineer</h2>

The UW has trained me to be confident in my skills and abilities as an engineer. Through my education, I feel comfortable navigating a highly technical field and addressing pressing challenges pertinent to the world today.  

<h2>Educator</h2>

My journey as an educator began with Riverways Education Partnerships' Environmental Alternative Spring Break Program 2012. This experience motivated me to help lead and facilitate the STEM Alternative Spring Break Program in 2017 and 2018. I continue my learnings as an educator with my teaching assistantship for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's ENGINE Capstone Program and my research, which addresses engineering design education and innovation. 

<h2>Entrepreneur</h2>

I was first introduced to entrepreneurship when I interned at Athena Energy Corp in 2015, a company with three people including myself and the CEO. The opportunity made me appreciate the fast paced and high impact environment of a startup. Since then, I have interned with another startup (Moonbeam) and am participating in the Foster School of Business's Tech Entrepreneurship Certificate (TEC) and the Hollomon Health Innovation Challenge.
