The Alternative Spring Break (ASB) Program initiated my unique UW experience. The program is a part of <a href = "https://expd.uw.edu/riverways/rural-tribal/">Riverways Education Partnerships </a> (formerly known as The Pipeline Project) and serves rural and tribal schools across Washington State. 

<h1>The Beginning</h1>

I first participated in the Environmental ASB (EASB) in 2013 in my freshman year. During spring break, my team taught elementary and middle school students at the Quileute Tribal School in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Push,_Washington">La Push</a>, about Washington's diverse environment. Simply the wonder that students expressed as they engaged with our activities was sufficient to convince me that this first experience as an educator won't be my last.

EASB was a critical juncture in my undergraduate trajectory. As I created curriculum on sustainability, I grew passionate about it. Therefore, I decided to switch my major from molecular biology to electrical engineering and study sustainable energy.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

Engineering was challenging. I constantly doubted my intellectual abilities and lost sight of why I changed majors. Instead of sustainability, I focused on embedded computing, because everyone else was doing it and it led to lucrative jobs. Due to muddled motivations, I pursued those jobs despite not finding them interesting. I graduated with a good grade, but lacked a sense of purpose. 

When I started my Masters program, I was looking to apply my engineering skills towards a cause. So, I approached The Pipeline Project with an idea to have an engineering ASB. Consequently, we worked with a new school (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger,_Washington">Granger</a> High School) in Yakima Valley and taught their students an engineering design curriculum.

ASB led me to be an engineer and an educator. Through it, I discovered that creating meaningful social impact drove my sense of purpose, regardless of where the impact was being created. In the process, I realized the importance of empathy and community as an educator, values I now apply as a teaching assistant.
