  "*Always go a little further into the water than you feel you're capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. 
  And when you feel that your feet aren't quite touching the bottom, you're just about in the right place to do something exciting*"

<h1>Starting with Gratitude</h1>

My journey at the UW began in 2012, when I arrived in Seattle from Dubai to study Molecular Biology. I was 17, in a different country, nervous yet excited. Almost a decade later, I am an engineer, still abuzz with excitement. However, my nervousness has been replaced by a solid sense of identity and values, which have been cultivated through a vibrant mosaic of UW experiences.  <br>

<br>

The Husky experience has given me with countless opportunities to learn, fail, grow and reflect on who I am and what is meaningful to me. Upon graduation, I will not only possess invaluable professional skills, but will have a wealth of incredible relationships for the rest of my life. The UW has shaped me into who I am now and I am grateful for being a part of its community and having the opportunities it has to offer.

-<b>Educator</b><br>

<br>

Through my in and out-of-class experiences as an educator, I have recognized that empathy, evidence and community drive my teaching philosophy. <br>

-<b>Entrepreneur</b><br>

<br>
UW's innovative ecosystem has motivated my interests in innovation and entrepreneurship, which inspires my graduate research work and future goals. <br>

<h1>Values</h1>

All elements of my identity are driven by three core values that revealed themselves through the course of my UW journey.
