In 2015, I interned at a startup called Athena Energy Corp. Although the startup failed, it was an incredible experience in developing a product from scratch and learning how a business worked. The experience drove my curious about how innovation works. ENGINE fueled the curiosity because supported participating companies in product development, allowing me to experience innovation in action. These experiences motivated me to pursue research in studying the innovation process. 

Meanwhile, after a summer internship at a big organization (Microsoft), I reflected on my experience at Athena and realized that at a smaller venture, I had greater ownership of the product and more opportunity for direct impact. So, I combined my research with entrepreneurial interests in order to "learn by doing" and enrolled in the Foster School of Business's Tech Entrepreneurship Certificate (TEC). 

Through TEC, I have had the opportunity to participate in an accelerator (Creative Destruction Labs), which helps digital health startups bring product to market. My team is also participating in the Holloman Health Innovation Challenge to evaluate our idea of a new type of vaginal dilator for women who suffer from vaginismus and related conditions.
