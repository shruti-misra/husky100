The Alternative Spring Break (ASB) Programs have catalyzed my unique UW experience. The ASB programs are a part of <a href = "https://expd.uw.edu/riverways/rural-tribal/">Riverways Education Partnerships </a> (formerly known as The Pipeline Project) that serve rural and tribal schools across Washington State. 

<h1>The Beginning</h1>

I first participated in the Environmental ASB in 2013 during my freshman year. My team worked with elementary and middle school students at the Quileute Tribal School in La Push, Washington. As an international student, I was motivated to participate in the program to learn more about Washington and its communities. 

EASB was a pivot point in my undergraduate trajectory. Educating students about the environment instilled in me a deep appreciation for it. Therefore, I decided to switch my major from molecular biology to electrical engineering with the hopes of studying sustainable energy. It was also my first experience as an educator. EASB was the first inkling that creating impact and connecting with a diverse community were core to my sense of purpose.


<h1>Giving Back</h1>

The switch to engineering was challenging. I suffered from imposter syndrome and lost sight of why I changed majors. Instead of pursuing sustainability, I focused on embedded computing, an area I was not excited by, but I pursued it because everyone around me was doing it as it led to better job prospects. I graduated with a good grade, but lost a sense of purpose. In 2016, I started my Masters program in electrical engineering and was looking for opportunities to use my skills to help communities in need.  

I approached The Pipeline Project with the idea to have an engineering ASB. Consequently, we engaged with a new school (Granger High School) in Yakima Valley and brought to its students an engineering design curriculum. I was involved with the program until 2020. 

The ASB programs prompted me to discover my values, realize my identity as an educator and be a confident engineer who could drive impact while connecting with communities in need. It highlighted the importance of empathy, culturally-responsive and community-oriented education, which inform the tenets of my teaching philosophy
