<h1>The Beginning</h1>

In 2015, I participated in the electrical and computer engineering department's pilot for a <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-capstone/">capstone course</a>, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. My team worked with Booz Allen Hamilton and I designed a system to track an underwater remotely operated vehicle. I was the only woman in the room, which added to my imposter syndrome. However, completing a challenging project while having a supportive team bolstered confidence in my engineering skills and elevated my sense of belonging.

<h1>Giving Back</h1>

Given my impactful capstone experience, I volunteered to mentor the team continuing my project next year. At this point, the program was growing and had much room for improvement. Therefore, I was delighted when I was made a lead teaching assistant (TA) for it in 2018, as it meant that I could substantially impact student experience. As a TA, I most enjoy connecting with students as they solve complex problems and reframing challenges as opportunities for learning.

In addition to providing a significant undergraduate engineering experience, ENGINE also inspired a shift in my PhD. My research initially focused on developing mathematical models for the innovation process. This direction felt too theoretical and removed from concrete application. Meanwhile, I saw the capstone as a platform for innovation and the students and industry mentors as agents driving the process. Therefore, I decided to study the capstone as part of my dissertation. The insights generated from my research inform evidence-based curricular interventions for the course. 

Through ENGINE I have 

-grown as an educator
-gained confidence and breadth of knowledge as an engineer
-discovered my interest in innovation and entrepreneurship.
